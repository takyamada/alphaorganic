hai.

Currently preparing to start working on V2 of this site and it is why I decided to join github.

V2 will be built within a php framework and use HTML5, JS, CSS, and Flash on the front end.  

Our V1 of the site is currently all flash and will still exist in V2 but will share a database for all its content.
